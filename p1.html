        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        Beginning to dip our toes into p5.js and basic digital sketching through code, the Critical Computation class was given the assignment 
        of turning plain, human language into code. To do this, we were paired up in partners, using only our partner's language 
        relating to an item they have lost in the past. The description I received from my partner stated that "a while ago I lost one of my favorite sweaters. 
        It was a grey hoodie with Hopkins on the front in a collegiate font that was stitched on top of 
        the fabric. The letters were white with a blue layer underneath so it had a sort of double 
        layered effect to it. There was stitching at the collar in that sort of v shape right below 
        the neck. It was a plush and comfortable crew neck that I really wish I still had" (Grant Willian, 2021).

        With a decently specific description of the lost item, there was no trouble sketching a common, grey crew neck
        on paper, with a font that matched the school of which the crew neck belonged to: John Hopkins University. Starting with a rough, 
        physical sketch with general parameters for angles and shapes helped immensely throughout the coding process, as this is one of the 
        first JavaScript sketches I have fully completed. To create the sense of elastic on the cuffs like a crew neck would have, I 
        utilized the line() shape to create many, tedious, small lines, which I believe rendered nicely on the neckline and sleeve cuffs. There are many imperfections within this 
        piece, as many of the lines do not match up perfectly, and I was not able to accomplish a level of interactivity that I desired. However,
        this project created a comfortable foundation that will easily be expanded upon throughout the semester.

      <p>
        As this was one of the first times I had ever constructed anything in JavaScript, it is clear that the transition between 
        physical and digital sketching is rather signinficant. There are much more limitations when using JavaScript to sketch; and many 
        times throughout the process, I wanted to simply click and drag on an object as if it were an Adobe application. I soon became more comfortable 
        manipulating the 2D Primitives' arguments and color properties, and it became easier to have fun with the coding process. This first activity has excited me to learn 
        more within the world of p5.js. Especially after participating in Open Projector and seeing what many of the MFA students are capable of, I am ready to continue this course 
        with eagerness to build my knowledge in coding.
