        Description
      </h1>
      
        <p>
        For the second week, the Critical Computation assignment called to continue using the 2-D Primitives as done 
        in the, but now the random() function has been introduced to our studies. The class was instructed to create a random 
        face generator that will be activated by function mousePressed() or function keyPressed(). 
        </p>
      
      <h1>
          Design Process 
      </h1>
        <p>
          I began this project by sketching a character onto paper, creating a round face with an exaggerated perspective, which I 
          considered to be an interesting composition for this assignment. After transferring my sketch to p5.js, I was impressed with the 
          ease that now came with the 2D Primitives. Using function mousePressed(), my character's eyes, pupils, mouth, lips, and face shape 
          will all translate at random with the click of the mouse. Additionally, I created a random color pallatte for the background. 
      </p>
      
      <h1>
          Original p5.js Sketch  
      </h1>
      
      <iframe
              allow ="camera"
              width = "400px"
              height = "400px"
              src="https://preview.p5js.org/ilesb520/embed/gfui3r3-p"></iframe>
      
        <p>
          As seen from the sketch, the amount of circles incorporated within the mouth, as well as an extensive amount of bezier
          curves to acheive the shape of the lips, created too many shapes and primitives that forced me to recreate in simpler terms. 
          In the future, I would like to go back into my original sketch to add several randomized properties, as my knowledge in p5.js increases. 
      </p>
      
      <h1>
          Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>
        The process throughout this assignment was rather challenging and consisted of many errors due to a lack of preparation that could have 
          been avoided. Waiting until finishing the p5.js sketch to determine what should move/ be randomized was the worst idea that was made 
          during this process. Working on the spot was confusing and overwhelming, and I had wished that my preparation process
          was as strong as week one to avoid wasting time and redoing work. My original sketch idea also became too complex 
          for my level of knowledge in coding, as it required too many variables and working parts that I still do not 
          posssess the capabilities to acheive yet. Overall, however, the sheer satisfaction that came when the 
          project was complete was rewarding. Creating the random() function in relation to my variables was the most difficult part 
          of this project, but I would confidently be able to recreate this now, proving that I have gained an understanding of these 
          computational concepts.
