        Description
      </h1>
      <p>
        Nothing is more stressful than time -- more specifically, the everpresent loss of time. With each passing second, 
        everything on the Earth is losing time that they will not be reimbursed. To negate this hostile idea
        of time, I decided to create an experimental clock that depicts serenity through the use of nature. 
        The frog sits upon a lily pad while a fly hovers above them. The top left lily pad depicts hours, the
        top right depicts minutes, and the pupils within the frog's eyes represents the seconds. When the next minute
        begins (when the frog's pupils are full circles) the mouth opens, showcasing a tongue and a second fly.

      <p>
        After having several challenges with my first two assignemnts, I approached this project with more 
        preparation, having a clear, physical representation of what I wanted to create before opening the 
        computer. I created a Procreate canvas with several layers to isolate each body part or moving element of the canvas. This was followed
        by several more sketches to acheive an image that was both realistic to create with my basic skill level in p5.js, as well as 
        something I believed was visually compelling. 
        After the Open Projector presentations from week 2, I knew that I wanted to incorporate the arctangent function 
        from the p5.js references library to track the pupils of the eyes with mouseX and mouseY. I was also able to utilize conditional 
        statements to create an "animation" shown in the mouth opening and closing when the top of the next minute hits. The flies were programmed
        using the random() function to displace the x and y axises in a range of -5 to 5.

      <p>
        Constructing a more intricate preparation and ideation process before starting my p5.js sketch has helped 
        me immensely. I benefitted greatly from creating multiple layers in Procreate to illustrate various parts 
        of the sketch, which assisted me in analyzing the logistics of the overall image. After completing the first two assignments, I am now starting to 
        become more confident and faster with coding. I have also started to think of new ways I can implement code in my personal projects. During weeks 
        one and two, I was enjoying what I was learning, but the material was simple, and I could not imagine how to create something from my 
        own imagination. Now, I am constantly thinking of new sketches to create, as well as new functions to experiment with.
