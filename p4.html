      <p>
        Through the Exquisite Corpse exercise, the class was divided into groups of three, and we each individually sketched character ideas.
        This p5.js sketch was created using the head of my original character and the body and feet of 
        my partners' two sketches.

        From this collaged reference, I was able to get a sense of how the final product would look compositionally. 
        Creating basic and references that are realistically acheivable has been the most helpful element when creating 
        p5.js sketches.

        Design Process
      </h1>
      <p>
        After my first three assignments within p5.js, I have entered a pretty comfortable work flow, which usually requires working from 
        the background from the foreground while following along with my reference. Near the end of my process, I realized that the sketch 
        alone was too flat with no interactivity. To resolve this, I incorporated an interesting foreground that replicates the iPhone camera
        interface. This was inspired by the change in aspect ration from 400px x 400px, which we had utilized in our last three assignments, to 400px x 600px. 
        Secondarily, I incorporated a backdrop that moves up incrimentally with the mouse click function and resets with the key pressed function.

        Reflection

      <p>
        This project has allowed me to expand upon my knowledge with 2-D primitives as well as naming and calling my own functions. 
        Working with other people's sketches and ideas was interesting, and what I have imagined I would render actually looks much 
        different with the incorporation of others' works. Regarding the concepts that were covered in class in relation to this assignment,
        I feel very comfortable using primitives and calling functions. However, there were two issues that I ran into during this project that 
        I could not resolve on my own. When the mouse is pressed, I originally wanted the balls to animate upwards at the click of a button; however, with my code, 
        the balls will only move incrementally each time the mouse is clicked. Overall, this assignment was fairly straight forward and has 
        continued to assist in my knowledge and practice of p5.js.
