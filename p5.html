        Description
      </h1>
      <p>
        To gain inspiration for this assignment, I researched old Italian and Spanish style patterns. These two 
        Italian patterns, which are quite similar to Spanish- style textiles, captivated me both in form and color palette. For this sketch, the 
        "spotlight" can have its color toggled with the click of a mouse, and the plaid pattern on top of the Italian-style 
        patterns can be toggled on an off by clicking any key on the keyboard. 
      </p>

        Design Process
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        Creating this sketch in p5.js required the use of 2D primitives, for loops, and mouse/keyboard 
        interaction. I was inspired by "Decodelia" (2016) by Melanie Hoff, who was mentioned in last week's lecture, and wanted to implement the same principles 
        of "cybersecurity" within my project. Using complementary colors of the blues within the patterns, I created a 
        plaid pattern that would inhibit the user from viewing the entirity of the artwork. Then, creating an ellipse that 
        is interactive with mouseX and mouseY, I was able to create a "spotlight" to unveil the patterns underneath.

        Reflection
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        Throughout the construction of this sketch, I was greatly impressed with my increased knowledge in if/else 
        statements to make the plaid pattern and the "spotlight" ellipse interactive. I was satisfied that the plaid grid is able 
        to toggle on and off, as well as the ellipse. However, because there are orange and yellow present in the 
        pattern alongside the lighter and darker blues, the "cybersecurity" effect I was attempting to replicated from 
        Melanie Hoff's "Decodelia" is not as visible as I would have wanted it to be. The spotlight can have its color toggled, because I wanted to experiment with 
        how different values of red can help unveil the original patterns in the sketch. This is something that I will continue to study and refine 
        as I continue working on this sketch: to create a more accurate spotlight effect where the patterns are nearly invisible until the spotlight is shown on 
        each piece.
