        Description 
      </h1>
      <p>
        For our sixth assignment, I created a data portrait that embodies one of my worst habits: nail biting.
        While this has been a bad habit for as long as I can remember, I wanted to use this assignment to analyze 
        if I could accurately track how many times I catch myself biting my nails. Data was recorded on Wednesday through 
        Sunday, and the data represented wihtin the sketch is how many times throughout each day I caught myself 
        biting my nails. Only four days out of this period are recorded within the sketch, since there were some days with very 
        little or identical data values. 
  
      </p>
      
       <h1>
        Design Process 
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        Following the curriculum, both arrays and for loops were implemented within this sketch, as well as 2D primitves and calling 
        personal functions. For each day of data that was translated onto the sketch, I created an array for the 
        rotational value of each "set". I then mapped the x-values of each function onto the x-values of the canvas' width, which would then 
        be used for the variable mouseX. This allows each day's shapes to independently rotate in its own, original way 
        as the mouse moves from left to right on the x-axis. I enjoyed working with each set of rotational rectangles, as I tried 
        to make them behave as organic forms, which took lots of refining and experimentation. Lastly, the choice to use beveled rectangles 
        stemmed from the motif of fingers and fingernails.
      </p>

        Reflection 
      </h1>

      <p>
        Unlike many of my other projects, I let the data guide the aesthetics for this project. Determining how many data points 
        I had each day really determined how each form would behave independently and as a whole. I enjoy the composition that I 
        have created, and I think the finger placed in the middle ties the piece together with a comical touch. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The only problem I have still yet to resolve is the mouseX's constraint on the canvas. When the mouse continues moving right 
        after reaching the end of the canvas, the shapes will continue to rotate. I am not sure why this is, because my map argument is written as so: 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        let m = map(mouseX, 0, width, -220, 220); //-220 to 220 is numerical value for x on rectangles, which allows the entire function to rotate 
      </p>
