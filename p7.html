        Design Proposal
      </h1>

      <p>
        For this assignment, I am creating a Pokemon inspired 
        story-telling RPG with a main character that is presented based off of myself. 
        The character finds himself wanting to get away from others to spend 
        some time alone. When his mother pesters him about a mysterious contraption 
        in the backyard, he learns that a time machine has been birthed from the sky 
        and fallen into his backyard. Upon entering the time machine 
        to do some exploring, several mini games and interactions will be implimented to control the 
        time machine and take the main character to different environments. 
        When the main character finds himself in a strange vortex with no exit, the help of a 
        mysterious stranger may be what he needs to get himself back to his home.

        Grey Boxing and Experimentation 
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        While I have not been able to solve the switch statement syntax yet, I have grey boxed individual scenes for my game, using functions to encapsulate and organize each component within each scene. 
        Iwill later consolidate these scenes into one p5.js sketch and code the switch statement transitions with specific actions.

        UPDATE: After learning how to utilize the switch statement alongside classes, I have learned how to create a game that changes scenes based on user interaction. 
For this game, scenes transition based off of character movements and collision detection, as well as mouse and key interaction, using function mousePressed() and function keyPressed().  
</p>
      
      <h1>
        Design Process 
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        At the beginning of my design process, I was still uncomfortable with utilzing classes and object-oriented coding 
        within my game. To create the grey boxed scene shown above, only functions were used to organize my code 
        by different assets within the code. I created a function for the furniture, the main character, and the time machine. 
        Once our Critical Computation Lab class started to analyze how to incorporate classes and obects into our projects, classes became a fun and efficient way to 
organize my code and create a modular system. 
        <br>
  </br> 
Throughout the creation of this game, my mind was racing with new ideas and ways to navigate the story. The final games has a total of 12 scenes including a final screen with the option 
to reset the game. While there were infinite ideas floating around in my head for mini games throughout the storyline, time was my 
worst enemy throughout this project, and I believe I could continue working on this game forever, continuously adding new assets, interactivity, and levels. 
      </p>
  
  <h1>
    Reflection
  </h1>
  <p>
    This project has been incredibly stimulating and insightful in my coding practice. I never thought that I would have so much fun 
    coding a video game. This project has sparked a new burst of creativity for me as well as show me a new way of storytelling, and I cannot 
    wait to improve my coding skills even more to create more intricate and interactive games within p5.js. 
    <br>
</br> 
There are still many things that need to be completed in order for me to consider this game "finished," including importing image assets, refining collision detection and dialogue interaction, and 
creating an opening menu screen. However, I believe that I have come quite a far way with this project. Additionally, my coding skills have become faster and more efficient. I am able to troubleshoot 
problems within my code easily and quickly now- more so than ever- and everything we have learned this semester is finally starting to come together to give me the ability
to create cohesive, interactive pieces that share a narrative.
