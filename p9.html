      <p>
        Learning about consentful interfaces throughout this course, the one thing that has captivated my attention the most is the problem with 
        large companies intentionally leaving out details in their terms and conditions when forcing you to accept them. This loophole 
        is extremely harmful, because they are technically not lying, but they are not being truly honest to their clients. This ultimately forces users to accept 
        certain specs in said software that they may not have been comfortable with sharing if they knew beforehand. From this issue, I planned to create an 
        interface that was not fantastically complex, but rather thoughtfully informative in a concise manner. The goal was to have the interface easily communicated to its
        users while preventing the preface from becoming an inconvenience to the user.

       Design Process 
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        To create this project, I first began with sketching flow charts to aid in visualizing the layout of the interface before coding. Again, I did not 
        want the consentful interface to become an inconvenience for the user, but I did want it to be informational before use. Deciding to keep the 
        length of scenes within my switch statement short, I varied where the buttons are located on each screen so that the user will stay engaged while learning 
        how to use the face filter. The 8-bit font I ended up using on each page is a nice addition that gives the entire interface a retro-electronic look, which 
        is an interesting combination when paired with the "futuristic" innovation of a facial recognition and face tracking coding library.

      <p>
        Honestly, I believe that this assignment was unnecessary for the trajectory of this course, but I can understand why the professors
        felt that it should be implemented. Designing interfaces and websites can be fun, but there is an added level of consent with this project that becomes robotic and unnatural. 
        With that being said, I still enjoyed coding this interface adn working with the clmtracker.js library. It has been great to learn about other libraries 
        that we can implement in our future p5.js sketches. At the moment, my consentful interface will only work until it is time for the camera to turn on. There seems 
        to be several complications with the added clmtracker.js library that I hope to sort out with my professor in my Critical Computation Lab class on Friday.
